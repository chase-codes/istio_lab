# Module 2: Service Mesh Value Proposition

**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Module 1 completion  
**Customer Focus**: Proving ROI and justifying architecture decisions

## The Customer Problem

Meet **Marcus Chen**, CTO at RapidScale, a Series B SaaS startup. While Sarah (Module 1) needed security, Marcus faces a different but equally critical challenge.

### Marcus's Situation
- **Company**: Fast-growing SaaS (150 employees, 40+ microservices)
- **Challenge**: Infrastructure complexity is slowing down feature development
- **Growth pressure**: 20% monthly growth, need to scale without breaking
- **Current pain**: Engineers spend 60% time on infrastructure, 40% on features
- **Investor pressure**: "Why is feature velocity decreasing as you scale?"

### The Business Impact
- **Developer productivity**: Feature delivery slowing from daily to weekly
- **Operational burden**: 2 DevOps engineers supporting 25 developers
- **Reliability issues**: Downtime affecting customer growth and retention
- **Competitive risk**: Slower time-to-market vs competitors

### What Marcus Needs
1. **Developer velocity**: Engineers focus on features, not infrastructure
2. **Operational efficiency**: Reliable scaling without growing DevOps team
3. **Clear ROI**: Justify infrastructure investment to board/investors
4. **Business agility**: Deploy features safely and quickly

**Your challenge as PM**: Demonstrate concrete business value and ROI of service mesh investment.

## Technical Foundation: Service Mesh Architecture & Value

Let's understand the architecture that enables business value for customers like Marcus.

### Lab Setup

```bash
cd ../01-foundation
make kind-up
```

## Exercise 1: The Current Developer Experience

### Step 1: Deploy Marcus's Microservices Environment

Create a realistic microservices setup to simulate Marcus's infrastructure challenges.

```bash
kubectl create deployment frontend --image=nginx --replicas=2
kubectl create deployment backend --image=nginxdemos/hello --replicas=3
kubectl create deployment database --image=postgres:13
kubectl set env deployment/database POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
kubectl expose deployment frontend --port=80
kubectl expose deployment backend --port=80
kubectl expose deployment database --port=5432
```

Why this step: Mirrors a typical 3‑tier microservice system so we can experience the current developer workflow and pain points before adding a mesh.

What this does:
- Creates Deployments for `frontend`, `backend`, and `database` (multiple replicas for realism)
- Exposes each as a Service so other workloads can reach them by stable names
- Seeds a simple database password via an environment variable (not best practice; used only for demo realism)

#### Verify: Check Environment Status

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl get services
```

You should see multiple replicas of each service running.

What to look for:
- Multiple `READY` pods per service (replicas)
- Services with ClusterIP addresses
- No visibility into which specific pod handles which request yet

### Step 2: Simulate Load Generation

```bash
kubectl run load-generator --image=busybox --restart=Never -- /bin/sh -c "while true; do wget -q --spider http://frontend; sleep 1; done"
```

Why this step: Real systems have constant background traffic. We generate steady requests so later tools (like Kiali) have data to visualize and you can observe latency/error changes when we tweak the system.

What this does: Starts a very small pod that makes an HTTP request to `frontend` every second. `--spider` checks reachability without downloading content; `-q` suppresses normal output.

#### Verify: Check Load Generator

```bash
kubectl logs load-generator
```

What to look for: With `-q --spider`, logs are typically quiet unless there are errors. No news is good news. To see visible output instead, you can run this alternative load generator:

```bash
kubectl run traffic-ping --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -- /bin/sh -lc 'while true; do date; curl -s -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code} in %{time_total}s\n" http://frontend; sleep 1; done'
```

### Step 3: Experience Developer Debugging Pain

Launch a debug session to simulate what Marcus's developers face daily.

```bash
kubectl run debug --image=nicolaka/netshoot -it --rm -- bash
```

Inside the debug pod, try to diagnose a production issue: "The frontend is slow. Which service is the bottleneck?"

```bash
nslookup frontend.default.svc.cluster.local
curl -w "Time: %{time_total}s\n" http://frontend/
curl -w "Time: %{time_total}s\n" http://backend/
exit
```

Why these commands:
- `nslookup` proves Kubernetes DNS resolves the `frontend` Service name to a stable virtual IP (ClusterIP).
- `curl -w time_total` measures end‑to‑end latency from this client to `frontend` and to `backend` for comparison.

What to look for:
- If `frontend` is slower than `backend`, the bottleneck might be between `frontend` and its dependencies (not visible yet). Without a mesh, you cannot see which backend instance is slow or whether there are retries/errors between services.

#### Reflection Questions
- Which backend instance is slow?
- Is the database connection healthy?
- What's the error rate between services?
- How would you safely deploy a new version?

**Marcus's perspective**: "Our engineers spend hours debugging issues that should take minutes"

## Exercise 2: Infrastructure Complexity Without Service Mesh

### Step 1: Show Manual Infrastructure Management

Create the configuration files that Marcus's team has to manage manually.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: logging-config
data:
  log-level: "info"
  format: "json"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend-health
spec:
  selector:
    app: frontend
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    targetPort: 80
    name: health
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: retry-config
data:
  max-retries: "3"
  timeout: "5s"
  backoff: "exponential"
EOF
```

Why this step: Illustrates how cross‑cutting concerns (logging formats, health checks, retries) are hand‑rolled by each team without a mesh, leading to inconsistency and toil.

What this does:
- `logging-config` suggests a shared log format that app teams must import and honor
- `frontend-health` exposes a separate port for health—another pattern teams re‑implement
- `retry-config` encodes retry policy in ConfigMaps—every team must wire this into their code

PM lens (business impact): Every divergent implementation increases operational burden, slows onboarding, and makes incident response inconsistent across teams.

#### Verify: Check Manual Configurations

```bash
kubectl get configmaps
kubectl get services
```

#### Reflection Questions
- How many different ways might teams implement retries?
- What happens when you need to change retry policies across 40+ services?
- How do you ensure consistent logging across all services?

**Marcus's perspective**: "Every team implements retries, circuit breakers, and monitoring differently"

## Exercise 3: Adding Service Mesh - Instant Infrastructure

### Step 1: Install Istio

```bash
make istio-sidecar
```

Why this step: Installs the control plane that will program per‑pod proxies. This enables security, traffic management, and observability without changing application code.

### Step 2: Enable Sidecar Injection

```bash
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
kubectl rollout restart deployment frontend backend database
```

What this does: Tells Kubernetes to automatically add an Envoy proxy sidecar to every pod in the `default` namespace, then restarts Deployments so new pods include the proxy.

### Step 3: Wait for Rollout Completion

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment frontend
kubectl rollout status deployment backend
kubectl rollout status deployment database
```

#### Verify: Check Sidecar Injection

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl describe pod $(kubectl get pod -l app=frontend -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') | grep -A5 "Containers:"
```

Each pod should now have 2 containers: the application and istio-proxy.

What to look for: In `describe pod`, under Containers you should see your app container and an `istio-proxy` container. No application code changed—capabilities are added at the infrastructure layer.

#### Reflection Questions
- What changed for Marcus's developers in terms of code?
- What infrastructure capabilities do they now have automatically?

**What changed for Marcus's developers:**
- **Automatic observability**: Metrics for every request
- **Built-in reliability**: Retries, circuit breakers, timeouts
- **Zero code changes**: Infrastructure capabilities without development work

## Exercise 4: Instant Observability Value

### Step 1: Deploy Observability Stack

```bash
make kiali
```

### Step 2: Generate Realistic Traffic

```bash
kubectl run traffic-generator --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never --rm -it -- sh
```

Inside the traffic generator:

```bash
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -s http://frontend/
  curl -s http://backend/
  sleep 0.1
done
exit
```

Why this step: Kiali (and metrics backends) need a stream of requests to show rates, latencies, and error percentages.

What to look for: After a short delay, edges between services should appear with request/second and latency percentiles. If you see no edges, wait a moment and refresh.

### Step 3: Explore Kiali Dashboard

Open the Kiali dashboard and explore:
- Service topology map
- Real-time traffic metrics
- Error rates and latencies
- Service dependencies

#### Verify: Check Traffic in Kiali

Look for:
- Green lines indicating healthy traffic
- Metrics showing request rates
- Service dependency graph

PM lens: This is the first time Marcus can see “who talks to whom,” at what rate, and how healthy those calls are—without asking developers to instrument code.

#### Reflection Questions
- How long would it take Marcus's team to build this visibility manually?
- What debugging time is saved with this instant observability?

**Marcus's ROI calculation**: 
- **Before**: 2 weeks to build custom monitoring per service
- **After**: Instant observability for all services
- **Savings**: 80% reduction in monitoring setup time

## Exercise 5: Deployment Safety Value

### Step 1: Demonstrate Unsafe Deployment

Show what happens with traditional Kubernetes deployments.

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/backend hello=nginxdemos/hello:latest
kubectl get pods -l app=backend -w
```

Stop watching with Ctrl+C when rollout completes.

Why this step: A traditional rolling update sends all traffic to whatever version happens to be live. If the new version is bad, customers see errors until you roll back.

What to look for: Pods terminate and new ones start. There’s no way to send only a small percentage of traffic to the new version first.

### Step 2: Create Canary Deployment Infrastructure

Prerequisite: Version labels for canary routing. The DestinationRule below routes by pod label `version`. Label most backend pods as `v1` and one pod as `v2` to simulate a new version:

```bash
kubectl label pod -l app=backend version=v1 --overwrite
POD=$(kubectl get pods -l app=backend -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl label pod "$POD" version=v2 --overwrite
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: backend-canary
spec:
  hosts: [backend]
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        canary: {exact: "true"}
    route:
    - destination: {host: backend, subset: v2}
  - route:
    - destination: {host: backend, subset: v1}
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: backend-versions
spec:
  host: backend
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels: {version: v1}
  - name: v2
    labels: {version: v2}
EOF
```

What this does:
- **DestinationRule** defines logical subsets (v1/v2) by pod labels.
- **VirtualService** routes requests with header `canary: true` to v2, while all other traffic goes to v1.

### Step 3: Test Canary Deployment

```bash
kubectl run debug --image=nicolaka/netshoot -it --rm -- bash
```

Inside debug pod:

```bash
curl -H "canary: true" http://backend/
curl http://backend/
exit
```

#### Verify: Traffic Routing

The canary header should route to v2, regular traffic to v1.

Business impact: You can safely test a new version with a small audience and instantly shift traffic or roll back without downtime.

#### Reflection Questions
- How does this reduce deployment risk?
- What's the business impact of zero-downtime deployments?

**Marcus's ROI calculation**:
- **Before**: 4-hour rollback window for bad deployments
- **After**: Instant traffic shifting, zero customer impact
- **Business value**: Eliminates deployment-related downtime

## Exercise 6: Developer Productivity Measurement

### Step 1: Show Automatic Features

```bash
kubectl run debug --image=nicolaka/netshoot -it --rm -- bash
```

Inside debug pod:

```bash
POD=$(kubectl get pod -l app=frontend -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
istioctl proxy-config clusters "$POD" | head -10
exit
```

Why this step: Peeking into the sidecar shows the infrastructure features (clusters/endpoints, retry policies, TLS settings) applied without any app code.

How to read this: You’re listing upstream clusters the proxy knows about. Seeing entries for `backend` confirms the mesh programs traffic for you.

### Step 2: Configure Circuit Breaker

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: backend-circuit-breaker
spec:
  host: backend
  trafficPolicy:
    connectionPool:
      tcp: {maxConnections: 10}
      http: {http1MaxPendingRequests: 10, maxRequestsPerConnection: 2}
    outlierDetection:
      consecutiveErrors: 3
      interval: 30s
      baseEjectionTime: 30s
EOF
```

#### Verify: Circuit Breaker Configuration

```bash
kubectl get destinationrule backend-circuit-breaker -o yaml
```

What this does (in business terms):
- **Connection pool limits** prevent any one client from overwhelming `backend`.
- **Outlier detection** automatically ejects unhealthy instances to protect users.

Why this matters: These reliability patterns are consistent across all services—no developer code required.

Optional (to see it in action):

```bash
# Generate bursty traffic and observe that unhealthy pods are ejected briefly
kubectl run load-burst --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -- /bin/sh -lc 'for i in $(seq 1 200); do curl -s -o /dev/null http://backend; sleep 0.05; done'
kubectl logs deploy/backend | tail -n 20 | cat
```

PM lens: Instead of teams building bespoke circuit breakers, platform sets one consistent policy that protects customer experience.

#### Reflection Questions
- How much code would developers need to write for these features?
- What's the consistency benefit of infrastructure-level policies?

**Marcus's developer productivity gains**:
- **Retries**: Built-in, no code required
- **Circuit breakers**: Infrastructure-level, consistent across services
- **Load balancing**: Automatic, health-aware
- **Monitoring**: Zero instrumentation code

## Exercise 7: ROI Calculation Workshop

Why this exercise: Translate technical capabilities into dollars and time saved so Marcus can justify investment to his board and plan hiring against platform leverage.

### Step 1: Calculate Current Infrastructure Costs

```bash
cat > marcus-current-costs.md << EOF
## Current Infrastructure Costs (Monthly) - Example Calculation

### Developer Time (assumes $150/hour blended rate)
- Debugging distributed issues: 40 hours/month × $150/hour = $6,000
- Implementing retry logic: 20 hours/month × $150/hour = $3,000  
- Setting up monitoring: 30 hours/month × $150/hour = $4,500
- Deployment troubleshooting: 25 hours/month × $150/hour = $3,750

### DevOps Team (assumes $200/hour senior rate)
- Manual service configuration: 60 hours/month × $200/hour = $12,000
- Incident response: 40 hours/month × $200/hour = $8,000

### Business Impact (highly variable by company)
- Deployment-related downtime: 4 hours/month × $10,000/hour = $40,000
- Delayed feature delivery: 2 weeks delay × $50,000 opportunity cost = $100,000

**Total Monthly Cost: $177,250 (range: $90k-$300k based on company size)**
EOF
```

PM guidance: Replace time and rate assumptions with your company’s actual data. Anchor on blended rates and historical incident metrics to keep the model credible.

### Step 2: Calculate Service Mesh Value

```bash
cat > marcus-service-mesh-value.md << EOF
## Service Mesh Value (Monthly)

### Developer Productivity Gains
- Reduced debugging time: 70% savings = $4,200 saved
- Eliminated retry implementation: 90% savings = $2,700 saved
- Zero monitoring setup: 100% savings = $4,500 saved
- Faster deployment troubleshooting: 80% savings = $3,000 saved

### DevOps Efficiency  
- Automated service configuration: 60% savings = $7,200 saved
- Faster incident resolution: 50% savings = $4,000 saved

### Business Impact
- Zero deployment downtime: $40,000 saved
- Faster feature delivery: 50% improvement = $50,000 value

**Total Monthly Value: $115,600**
**ROI: 652% (excluding infrastructure costs)**
EOF
```

How to present: Lead with outcomes (faster releases, fewer incidents), then show the calculation that ties platform features to saved engineering hours and avoided downtime.

### Step 3: Analyze DORA Metrics Impact

```bash
cat > dora-metrics-improvement.md << EOF
## DORA Metrics: Service Mesh Impact

### Deployment Frequency
- Before: Weekly releases (fear of breaking production)
- After: Daily releases (canary deployments reduce risk)
- Improvement: 7x increase in deployment frequency

### Lead Time for Changes  
- Before: Code to production in 5-7 days (complex deployment process)
- After: Code to production in 1-2 days (streamlined with traffic management)
- Improvement: 60% reduction in lead time

### Change Failure Rate
- Before: 15% of deployments cause incidents (all-or-nothing deployment)
- After: 3% cause incidents (canary catches issues early)
- Improvement: 80% reduction in change failure rate

### Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
- Before: 4 hours (complex rollback procedures)
- After: 30 seconds (instant traffic shifting)
- Improvement: 99% reduction in MTTR
EOF
```

#### Verify: Review ROI Analysis

```bash
cat marcus-current-costs.md
echo "---"
cat marcus-service-mesh-value.md
echo "---"
cat dora-metrics-improvement.md
```

#### Reflection Questions
- How would you adjust these numbers for your specific context?
- What other business impacts should be considered?
- How do you measure developer productivity improvements?

## Exercise 8: Competitive Comparison

### Step 1: Build vs Buy Analysis

```bash
cat > build-vs-buy.md << EOF
## Build Your Own Service Mesh

### Engineering Investment
- 6 senior engineers × 12 months = $1.8M
- Ongoing maintenance: 2 engineers × $300k/year = $600k/year
- Feature parity timeline: 18-24 months

### Risk Factors
- Opportunity cost of not building features
- Technical debt and maintenance burden  
- Security vulnerabilities in custom code
- Scaling and performance optimization

## Adopt Istio Service Mesh

### Investment
- Learning curve: 2 engineers × 2 months = $100k
- Migration effort: 3 months implementation = $150k
- Ongoing operations: 0.5 engineer = $75k/year

### Benefits
- Immediate value (weeks, not years)
- Battle-tested at scale (Google, Netflix, etc.)
- Community support and ecosystem
- Focus on business value, not infrastructure

**Conclusion: 90% cost savings, 95% faster time-to-value**
EOF
```

### Step 2: Alternative Solutions Analysis

```bash
cat >> build-vs-buy.md << EOF

## Alternatives That Provide Partial Value

### Deployment Tools (Argo Rollouts, Flagger)
- **What they provide**: Canary deployments, blue-green rollouts
- **What they don't**: Identity-based policies, automatic mTLS, unified observability
- **Synergy with mesh**: Can work together - rollouts for app-level deployment, mesh for network-level control

### Gateway + Ingress Controllers (NGINX, Envoy Gateway)
- **What they provide**: North-south traffic management, some L7 policies
- **What they don't**: East-west service communication, automatic certificate management
- **When sufficient**: API-first architectures with simple internal communication

### Application Performance Monitoring (APM) Tools
- **What they provide**: Application-level observability, some distributed tracing
- **What they don't**: Network-level insights, policy enforcement, automatic security
- **Integration**: Service mesh telemetry enhances APM with network context
EOF
```

PM talk track (steel‑man first):
- Acknowledge that deployment controllers, gateways, and APMs solve real parts of the problem very well
- Position mesh as the consolidation layer for runtime identity, L7 policy, and uniform telemetry across teams at scale
- Emphasize coexistence: keep best‑of‑breed tools and add mesh where cross‑service consistency is required

#### Verify: Review Analysis

```bash
cat build-vs-buy.md
```

#### Reflection Questions
- When might building your own solution make sense?
- How do you position against partial solutions?
- What's the right integration strategy with existing tools?

## Exercise 9: Platform Team Value

### Step 1: Demonstrate Platform Capabilities

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: IstioOperator
metadata:
  name: control-plane
spec:
  meshConfig:
    defaultConfig:
      retryPolicy:
        retryOn: "5xx,reset,connect-failure,refused-stream"
        numRetries: 3
        retryDelayPolicy:
          type: exponential
          initialDelay: 1s
          maxDelay: 10s
    defaultProviders:
      metrics: ["prometheus"]
      tracing: ["jaeger"]
EOF
```

#### Verify: Platform Configuration

```bash
kubectl get istiooperator -o yaml
```

Why this step: Shows how the platform team can set org‑wide defaults (retries, telemetry providers) once, without touching app code.

What to look for: The `IstioOperator` reflects centralized defaults. New services inherit these policies automatically.

PM lens: Policies defined once are applied everywhere—reducing cognitive load on developers and accelerating consistent best practices.

#### Reflection Questions
- How does this enable platform team efficiency?
- What's the value of consistent policies across all services?

**Platform team value**: Set policies once, benefit everywhere

### Step 2: Multi-Environment Consistency

```bash
kubectl create namespace staging
kubectl label namespace staging istio-injection=enabled
kubectl apply -n staging -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: backend-staging
spec:
  hosts: [backend]
  http:
  - route:
    - destination: {host: backend}
EOF
```

#### Verify: Cross-Environment Policies

```bash
kubectl get virtualservice -n staging
kubectl get virtualservice -n default
```

**DevOps value**: Consistent behavior across dev/staging/prod

## Customer Application: Presenting to Marcus

Practice explaining the business value to Marcus and his board.

### The Business Problem Recap
*"Marcus, you mentioned that infrastructure complexity is slowing down feature development. Let me show you how service mesh turns infrastructure into a competitive advantage..."*

### The Value Demonstration

```bash
make kiali
```

In Kiali, demonstrate:
1. "This is your current service topology - visible for the first time"
2. "These green lines show healthy communication, red shows problems"  
3. "Here's real-time latency - you can see bottlenecks instantly"
4. "This is automatic - no code changes required"

### Deployment Safety Demo

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: safe-deployment-demo
spec:
  hosts: [backend]
  http:
  - route:
    - destination: {host: backend, subset: v1}
      weight: 90
    - destination: {host: backend, subset: v2}  
      weight: 10
EOF
```

"Deploy new versions with 10% traffic, monitor, then increase or rollback"

### ROI Presentation Framework
1. **Current costs**: Time spent on infrastructure vs features
2. **Service mesh value**: Automatic capabilities, reduced manual work
3. **Business impact**: Faster deployment, reduced downtime, developer focus
4. **Competitive advantage**: Deploy features faster than competitors

### Handling Investor/Board Questions

**"What's the risk of adopting this technology?"**
- *"Istio is used by Google, Netflix, and thousands of enterprises. The risk is NOT adopting it - your competitors are gaining deployment speed and reliability advantages."*

**"How long until we see ROI?"**
- *"Immediate observability value in week 1. Deployment safety in week 2. Full productivity gains in month 1. Break-even typically within 60 days."*

**"What if we build this ourselves?"**
- *"Building your own service mesh would take 18+ months and $2M+. Istio gives you the same capabilities in weeks, letting your engineers focus on features that drive revenue."*

## Key Takeaways

### Technical Understanding
- **Architecture enables business value**: Control plane + data plane = automatic capabilities
- **Zero code changes**: Infrastructure provides cross-cutting concerns
- **Progressive adoption**: Can implement gradually, immediate value

### Business Value Framework
- **Developer productivity**: Focus on features, not infrastructure
- **Operational efficiency**: Reduce manual work, faster incident response  
- **Business agility**: Safe deployments, faster time-to-market
- **Competitive advantage**: Infrastructure as differentiator

### PM Skills
- **ROI calculation**: Quantify time savings and business impact
- **Risk mitigation**: Address concerns with concrete evidence
- **Value demonstration**: Show, don't just tell business benefits

## Troubleshooting Guide

#### If Kiali dashboard not showing traffic:
```bash
kubectl run traffic-gen --image=fortio/fortio --rm -it -- load -qps 10 -t 60s http://frontend/
istioctl proxy-status
```

#### If metrics not appearing:
```bash
kubectl -n istio-system get pods -l app=prometheus
curl "http://$(kubectl -n istio-system get svc prometheus -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'):9090/api/v1/query?query=istio_requests_total"
```

#### If VirtualService not working:
```bash
istioctl analyze
istioctl proxy-config routes $(kubectl get pod -l app=frontend -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') --name http
```

## Cleanup

```bash
kubectl delete virtualservice --all
kubectl delete destinationrule --all
kubectl delete deployment frontend backend database load-generator
kubectl delete service frontend backend database frontend-health
kubectl delete configmap logging-config retry-config
kubectl delete namespace staging
rm -f marcus-*.md dora-metrics-improvement.md build-vs-buy.md
```
